This is a project I did with Evan David and Lucas Mueller for Contemporary Physics in which we compared various methods commonly employed in the undergraduate laboratory for measuring the Earth's magnetic field. Because this was during Covid times and we were spread across the country, we analyzed two methods: single-coil deflection and Helmholtz deflection, and we also used smartphone sensors to measure local fluctuations in the ambient fields. I took on the single-coil deflection method and built my own setup which turned out to provide accuracy within the range given by smartphone sensors and uncertainty of the accepted values.
