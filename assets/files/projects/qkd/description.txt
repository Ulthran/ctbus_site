Quantum key distribution is a scheme for provably secure, optical communications that I researched as a project for Quantum Mechanics. The twin-fields QKD protocol is a relatively recent advancement in the field in which an untrusted intermediary is used to partially overcome the rate-distance limit, which is a fundamental issue with the field of optical communications. I explore this as well as BB84, the original QKD protocol, and theoretical protocols based on quanutum repeaters.
