This is a project I did with April Reisenfeld in Numerical Analysis on how Schmidt decomposition is used in quantum information theory. In the paper we build up the necessary theoretical and mathematical background for understanding this application of Schmidt decomposition and then provide a specific example of how it can be used to build a quantum circuit for qubit state initialization. We then demonstrate how this can be done using a simple example programmed on IBM's quantum cloud with Qiskit.
