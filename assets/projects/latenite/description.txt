LateNite is a party planning app that I worked with Rachel Hodes to design for the Carleton startup competition. The app is built using React Native on AWS Amplify so that it is accessible from iOS, Android, or the web. This was my first experience designing a mainly JavaScript-based site. I was in charge of the technical side of things while Rachel managed most of the design and marketing materials and we worked together on financial projections with our advisor Ashley Lin. We ended up among the finalists but didn't win (only one prize :().
