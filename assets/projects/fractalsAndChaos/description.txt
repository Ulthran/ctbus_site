Chaotic systems' trajectories through phase space have a tendency to produce fractals and so, measuring the fractal dimension of chaotic attractors can be a way of quantifying their complexity. In this project I explore methods for measuring the fractal dimensions of various chaotic attractors and then analyze the trends in complexity as the systems move through their parameter spaces.
