 Section 01 : Introduction
</p>



<p class="Text">
 In this notebook, we will be looking at dissipative chaotic systems and how to make use of their periodicity, and the fractals arising from this property, to determine their complexities. Many of these terms, even if they are things you have heard in other contexts, need to be carefully defined for this project so we&rsquo;ll begin with some definitions.<br /><br />1. Dissipative Chaotic Systems:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A system is a chunk of the universe that we decide to look at in great detail. A pool table, for example, is a system wherein there are some point-like masses and a rectangular boundary. This is a good system to consider because it is largely isolated from its environment (meaning stuff around it, like air or a lamp, doesn&rsquo;t have much effect on what happens) and it exhibits some chaotic behaviors. A chaotic system can be (over)simply defined as one in which very small changes in initial conditions can result in vastly different dynamics within the system. Take the pool table; when you&rsquo;re starting a game and you have to break the triangle, it never breaks the same way twice. This is because tiny changes in the angle and speed at which you hit the cue ball cause completely different things to happen in the system. A pool table is also a dissipative system because there is a force taking energy out of the system: friction. This just means that the particles in the system will continue to slow down over time. We will see why this is important in the next definition.<br />2. Periodicity: <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An odd but very cool feature of chaotic systems is that they are periodic. This means that if a chaotic system with one &ldquo;object&rdquo; in it starts at point A it will eventually return there with the same velocity it had when it started. However, this feature has to be amended for dissipative chaotic systems because the path traced out by the &ldquo;object&rdquo; in a dissipative chaotic system is going to get smaller and smaller with each period meaning that instead of returning to point A it will return to point A&rsquo; which will just be a lower energy state version of A. This means that it will be tracing out the same pattern but smaller and smaller each time. And this leads us into fractals...<br />3. Fractals (Fractal Dimensions):<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A fractal is a curve or geometric figure that is self-similar at any scale. This means that it should look the same whether you&rsquo;re looking at the whole thing or just a tiny piece of it. A relatively simple example of this is shown in Figures 1.1 and 1.2. Fractals can be found in lots of interesting places in nature and one of those is dissipative chaotic systems. To quote the last definition: &ldquo; it will be tracing out the same pattern but smaller and smaller each time.&rdquo;<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="InputInline"><span><img src="HTMLFiles/Final Project - Main Notebook_1.gif" alt="Final Project - Main Notebook_1.gif" width="220" height="220" style="vertical-align:middle" /></span></span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span><span><img src="HTMLFiles/Final Project - Main Notebook_2.gif" alt="Final Project - Main Notebook_2.gif" width="220" height="220" style="vertical-align:middle" /></span></span><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figure 1.1: The Sierpinski Carpet&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Figure 1.2: The top left corner of Figure 1.1 <br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The fractal dimension of a chaotic system is not actually one well defined quantity because there are a number of different &ldquo;dimensions&rdquo; that a chaotic system has and that can be measured. In this notebook we will be looking at the fractal dimension as if the path of the system is simply a fractal pattern. This means that we will be measuring it using both the box counting method and the correlation function in Section 2.0.<br />4. Complexity:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Complexity is a term that can take a huge variety of meanings throughout physics and even in the context of fractals. In this project, we will be defining complexity as the amount of space that a chaotic system&rsquo;s path fills. Basically this means that, if we consider the path of a fractal to be a one dimensional curve, then the amount of 2D space that it fills is the complexity of the system.<br /><br />With these definitions in mind, this notebook will be broken up into seven sections (including this intro). The second will contain statistical functions for calculating the fractal dimension such as the box counting function and the correlation function. The third and fourth sections will be focused on analyses of the Henon map and the Tinkerbell map (aka as Henon/Tinkerbell attractor), both of which are chaotic systems. The fifth and sixth sections will be focused on the same maps but this time on how their fractal dimensions change over changes in their parameters. The final section will be a conclusion.

 Section 02 : Needed Packages And Statistical Functions
</p>



<p class="Text">
 This section is home to two methods that calculate the fractal dimension (FD) of an input map of a system. The first method is a box counting method that takes in a Graphics object for its only argument. It then overlays boxes of varying sizes over the image and counts the number of points in each box and sums these, each divided by the total number of points. In this way, with different size boxes being overlaid on each iteration, it can find the space filling capability of the fractal at many scales.<br />The second method does something very similar but takes a slightly more mathematical approach to it. The input is a list of points now. Instead of overlaying boxes, it looks at each point individually and counts up all the points within an input radius. It then does the same dividing and summing as the box counting method. Over a range of radius inputs, this should provide an exponential curve with an exponent that is the fractal dimension.<br />The third method is a function that determines the radius of gyration of the input cluster. This is important to determine because the correlation function starts giving variable results once the input radius reaches and surpasses the radius of gyration.<br />The main reason to have two different methods for making the same calculation is that it will provide an easy check on the accuracy of both of them; if they come out the same it is probably working, otherwise it probably isn&rsquo;t.

 Section 03 : Analysis of the Henon Dissipative Map for One Parameter Set
</p>



<p class="Text">
 In this section, we will be looking at the Henon dissipative map for a single parameter set. The parameters we will be using are &alpha; = 1.4 and &beta; = 0.3. There are three subsections, the first of which will focus on generating the Henon map and the second and third of which will focus on calculating the fractal dimension of the resultant map from the first subsection.<br />We will be looking at the Henon map because it is a very well known chaotic attractor which is a relatively light computational load to simulate. The benefit of it being well known is that there are many studies on the Henon attractor and thus many sources to verify results we find here.
</p>



<p class="Subsection">
 Section 03.1 : Generating the Henon Map
</p>



<p class="Text">
 Here we will be developing and testing our function for generating Henon maps. The basic idea behind a mapping function is that it is a function that takes in a coordinate and then applies some transformation to it that translates physically to the movement of a particle over a specific time step. The function is used over and over again to create a list of points that trace out the path of the particle over time. This method is preferable to actually tracing the path of the particle because a path cannot be input into the correlation function.<br />The Henon map works on the equations:<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span><span><img src="HTMLFiles/Final Project - Main Notebook_6.png" alt="Final Project - Main Notebook_6.png" width="24" height="19" style="vertical-align:middle" /></span></span> = <span style='font-style: italic;'>1 - </span><span><span><img src="HTMLFiles/Final Project - Main Notebook_7.png" alt="Final Project - Main Notebook_7.png" width="31" height="19" style="vertical-align:middle" /></span></span><span><span><img src="HTMLFiles/Final Project - Main Notebook_8.png" alt="Final Project - Main Notebook_8.png" width="10" height="19" style="vertical-align:middle" /></span></span> + <span><span><img src="HTMLFiles/Final Project - Main Notebook_9.png" alt="Final Project - Main Notebook_9.png" width="15" height="19" style="vertical-align:middle" /></span></span><br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span><span><img src="HTMLFiles/Final Project - Main Notebook_10.png" alt="Final Project - Main Notebook_10.png" width="25" height="19" style="vertical-align:middle" /></span></span> = <span><span><img src="HTMLFiles/Final Project - Main Notebook_11.png" alt="Final Project - Main Notebook_11.png" width="22" height="19" style="vertical-align:middle" /></span></span><br />Meaning that it takes in a coordinate pair <span><span><img src="HTMLFiles/Final Project - Main Notebook_12.png" alt="Final Project - Main Notebook_12.png" width="18" height="19" style="vertical-align:middle" /></span></span><span style='font-style: italic;'>, </span><span><span><img src="HTMLFiles/Final Project - Main Notebook_13.png" alt="Final Project - Main Notebook_13.png" width="15" height="19" style="vertical-align:middle" /></span></span>) and then outputs <span><span><img src="HTMLFiles/Final Project - Main Notebook_14.png" alt="Final Project - Main Notebook_14.png" width="28" height="19" style="vertical-align:middle" /></span></span>, <span><span><img src="HTMLFiles/Final Project - Main Notebook_15.png" alt="Final Project - Main Notebook_15.png" width="25" height="19" style="vertical-align:middle" /></span></span>) according to these equations. The NestWhileList[] function will repeat this process until one of a number of checks returns false. The coordinate pairs it returns are turned into a graphics object that is then output from the function. We will then run a test with values of &alpha; = 1.4 and &beta; = 0.3 for which we have a reference value for the FD.

 This subsection will be focused on finding the fractal dimension of the Henon map produced above (Figure 3.1) using the squaresMethod[]. We will also see an animation of the process that the squaresMethod[] uses to make its calculations.<br />A brief note on the squaresMethod[] output: The output is a list of four elements. The first (henonData[[1]] in this case) is the log-log list of data it calculated, the second is the best fit line for that data calculated with LinearModelFit[]. The third is the ParametersTable for the best fit line including the estimated fractal dimension and the error bound. The fourth is the FD estimate returned as a number, separate of the table.

 Section 03.3 : Analyzing the Fractal Dimension by Means of the correlationFunction[]

<p class="Text">
 In this subsection, we will be using the correlationFunction[] from Section 02 to determine the fractal dimension of the Henon map we made earlier in this section. We will do this by making a table of correlation values from radii of just over zero up to the radius of gyration of the map. By then plotting the log of that data and getting a linear fit model we should be able to calculate the fractal dimension of the system which (hopefully) will match that from subsection 03.2.

 Figure 3.4 : Results of the correlationFunction[] Run on the Henon Map<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This plot shows the log of the data from the correlationFunction[]. Once again it provides a very linear trend with a slope that matches the fractal dimension we expect.
</p>



<p class="Text">
 According to Eric W. Weisstein&rsquo;s Henon Map article on wolfram mathworld and Estimating fractal dimension by James Theiler, the fractal dimension of the Henon map with parameters &alpha; = 1.4 and &beta; = 0.3 should be 1.25 &plusmn; 0.02. This matches very well with our results in this section. With the squaresMethod[] we got 1.25 &plusmn; 0.02 and with the correlationFunction[] we got 1.23 &plusmn; 0.01, both of which fall within the error bars for the researched value. Thus, we can conclude that our two methods for calculating the fractal dimension of a chaotic system is working (at least for this system with these parameters). In the next section we will test our methods further on the Tinkerbell attractor.
</p>



<p class="Section">
 Section 04 : Analysis of the Tinkerbell Map for One Parameter Set
</p>



<p class="Text">
 This section will be very similar to the last section with really the only difference being that we are working with the Tinkerbell attractor instead of the Henon attractor. We will again be using only one unchanging set of parameters in this section and we will be using both methods to try to get a fractal dimension that matches up with our researched value of 1.3992 from Bifurcation and chaos in the Tinkerbell map.

 Figure 4.3 : Results of the correlationFunction[] Run on the Tinkerbell Map<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, we receive a very linear log plot with a slope of 1.38 which is very close to the researched value for the fractal dimension of the Tinkerbell Map and is within the error bar.
</p>



<p class="Text">
 This section has gotten results almost as good as Section 03 with the Henon map. Here we got one value for the fractal dimension that is within the error bound from the correlationFunction[], 1.38 &plusmn; 0.02 and one value that is just outside the error bound from the squaresMethod[], 1.36 &plusmn; 0.01. The researched value we are using as the true value comes from Bifurcation and chaos in the Tinkerbell map and is 1.3992. The lower value for the squaresMethod[] is not entirely unreasonable either, because the center of the map is so densely packed that it may skew calculations for smaller square overlays. This is an unfortunate defect, but one we&rsquo;ll have to live with because it cannot be easily remedied.

<p class="Text">
 Now we are getting into the interesting part of this project where we will be looking for patterns in the change of the fractal dimension with changes in the system parameters. In this first section of parameter changes, we will be looking at the Henon map, first at variations in the &beta; parameter and then at changes in both the &alpha; and &beta; parameters. The goal of this section and the next is to find a trend or pattern in the change of the fractal dimension over changes in parameters because such a trend or pattern would lend some sort of predictability to these chaotic systems.

<p class="Subsection">
 Section 06.1 : Variation in the Beta Parameter
</p>



<p class="Text">
 In this first subsection, we will be looking at how the Henon map&rsquo;s complexity changes over changes in the &beta; parameter. To do this effectively, it is necessary to look at changes on multiple scales, meaning on varying step sizes for the &beta; parameter. For example, in this section we are looking at a data set that ranges from 0.99 to 0.999 by steps of 0.001, then from 0.999 to 1.000 by steps of 0.0001, and then from 1.001 to 1.010 again by steps of 0.001. This varied resolution over the data set is necessary because it will hopefully discredit any apparent trends on larger or smaller scales that aren&rsquo;t actually there.

 Figure 6.6 : Plot of the Fractal Dimension of the Henon Map Over Smaller Changes in the &alpha; and &beta; Parameters<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This plot shows the plot of the fractal dimension as a function of &alpha; and &beta; for a smaller range of&nbsp;&nbsp;&alpha; and &beta; values and for higher resolutions of both.

 Despite the higher resolution, the second plot appears to just be a zoomed in image of the first, which is promising evidence supporting a conclusion that the fractal dimension might follow a trend decided by the &beta; parameter.

 In this section, we will doing the same thing as in Section 06 but this time with the Tinkerbell map. Because the Tinkerbell map has four parameters and there is no easy way to graph changes over four parameters, we are going to look at change in one parameter, c, and if there is nothing promising there, redirect attention to the more promising Henon map.

 Figure 7.2 : Plot of the Fractal Dimension of the Tinkerbell Map Over Changes in the C Parameter<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no evidence of patterning here. It could be hidden as with the &beta; plot for the Henon map but it would not be easy to uncover if it is hidden because there are three other parameters to deal with here rather than just the one other that the Henon plot has.
</p>



<p class="Text">
 Like with the changes in the &beta; parameter for the Henon map, there is no obvious sign of patterning to this data. It could be that with further investigation of the other three parameters we might find interesting trends like with the Henon map but without some way to narrow down what exactly to look for, that could be a project all to itself.
</p>



<p class="Section">
 Section 08 : Conclusion
</p>



<p class="Text">
 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The only reason anyone would be interested in this work for practical reasons is if I can actually find a pattern that would give some sort of predictive power over the complexity of a system. And in order to have predictive power, we need to have a function or a trend that can describe the exact relation between the FD and one or more of the parameters. Whether or not I have actually succeeded in finding such a pattern is not entirely clear and would require more simulations to verify but it does appear, just on the bases of the two plots from Section 06, that there might be a pattern.The first graph is a plot of the fractal dimension versus the two parameters for the Henon function. The second graph runs over a smaller range of &beta; values with higher resolution. In other tests of this sort, where I enhance the resolution to look at a smaller section, I usually get results that are just as erratic as the original results but within that smaller window.This case is different though, because here, the enhanced resolution looks almost identical to the original.This may mean that there is a trend linking the FD and &beta; values which could be found for any &alpha;. It' s also possible that I just picked some particularly nice looking points and got a deceptively nice looking graph as a result. There is certainly evidence elsewhere in the project to refute the patterning found here.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The major takeaway from this project is uncertain at best which is not ideal, but it does warrant further investigation into the subject. Perhaps more importantly, this project sets solid groundwork for this continuing investigation. I now have a very easy-to-use method with verified results to determine the fractal dimension and thus the complexity of chaotic systems. Possibilities for further research include looking more for patterns between parameters and the fractal dimension of a system, looking for ways to better deal with problems in the methods for calculating fractal dimensions, and looking into what the various types of fractal dimensions of a system are (yes, there are many of them!) and if there are any patterns to be found in these FDs with parameters.<br />

A lot of the foundational knowledge of this project comes from this website.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Estimating fractal dimension: James Theiler<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I learned how to implement the correlation function for a fractal created by a mapping function from this article and I found one of the maps I would be using (Henon) along with a value for its fractal dimension at the parameter values I used in Section 03.<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Henon Map: Eric W. Weisstein from MathWorld<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This site provides a bit of information on the Henon map including what equations are used in its mapping function and what the expected value for the fractal dimension should be for the parameters used in Section 03 (matching the value given in Theiler&rsquo;s article).<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br />Measuring the fractal dimension of a tree photo: Szabolcs Horvat<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is the article in which the squaresMethod[] is developed and where the code is pulled from.
