A project I completed with Kyle Fraser-Mines, Jack Heinzel, and Axel Stahl for Classical Mechanics. We use Mathematica to model a trebuchet with Lagrangian techniques and then optimize it over a small subset of its parameter space. In conjunction with this, we also built a trebuchet out of Knex and various other materials to the specifications of our model and managed to launch marbles across a room.
