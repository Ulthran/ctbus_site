        <h2 class="text-h6 font-weight-bold mb-2">About the PCMP</h2>
        <p>
          The Pennâ€‘CHOP Microbiome Program is a joint effort between the Perelman
          School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and the Children&#39;s
          Hospital of Philadelphia. The program supports researchers studying the
          microbiome by providing analysis expertise, open-source tools and
          compute infrastructure.

        <h2 class="text-h6 font-weight-bold mb-2">Human Gut Metagenomics</h2>
        <p>
          The human gut contains trillions of microbes. Instead of culturing each
          one individually, we sequence all DNA from a sample and use computational
          pipelines to piece together who is there and what they&#39;re doing. These
          approaches reveal links between the microbiome and health or disease.

        <h2 class="text-h6 font-weight-bold mb-2">My Role</h2>
        <p>
          As the program&#39;s software engineer I establish development standards,
          refactor published work and build internal services ranging from
          preprocessing automation to statistical packages. I have led many projects 
          through from creation to production or through major upgrades, often 
          working cross-functionally with researchers and analysts across lab groups.

      <v-col cols="12" md="6" class="text-center">
        <h2 class="text-h6 font-weight-bold mb-2">Tech Stack</h2>
        <p>
          Python and R make up the core of our work with frameworks like Snakemake,
          Prefect, Flask, and Docker. For orchestration we rely largely on SLURM and
          Kubernetes with GitHub and GitHub Actions for source control and CI/CD.
          Increasingly, AI tools such as OpenAI/Azure Chat APIs, CoPilot, Codex, and
          LangChain/LangGraph are being integrated across the SDLC to enhance
          productivity and analysis capabilities.
