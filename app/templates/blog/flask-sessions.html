<div class="container mx-auto flex-1 mt-8 md:p-4 p-2 text-center md:w-1/2">
    <p class="text-lg text-left">The issue of storing session data on this site came up when I started trying to build a Spotify stats visualizer. The Spotify Web API requires an access token which is retrieved with a combination of the app's API key and the user's login information. The access token then has to be stored somehow so that the user doesn't have to login again everytime the app makes a request. In the case of a web app, it is stored as session data. And as it happens, there are a lot of ways to store session data for a website.</p>

    <div class="flex flex-wrap items-center justify-between p-5 md:mx-10">
        <a href="{{ url_for('music') }}" target="_blank" class="text-white" title="Spotify Stats">
            {{ svgs.music(class="w-12 h-12") }}
        </a>

        <a href="{{ url_for('session_info') }}" target="_blank" class="text-white" title="Session Info">
            {{ svgs.data(class="w-12 h-12", stroke="#000000") }}
        </a>
    </div>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold my-4">What is Session Data</h3>

    <p class="text-lg text-left">Session data is information that is associated with a particular user of a website and that persists for some amount of time. It can be stored locally on a user's computer, locally on the server running the website, or in a remote database. How it is persisted can also vary to dependent on a timeout, a user action, an administrator action, etc. There are not so minute minutiae I'm skimming here like the difference between session and cookies and more I'm probably not aware of but for this case I was just looking for the simplest way to persist information for a user on my site.</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold my-4">First Try: Flask-Session with Filesystem</h3>

    <p class="text-lg text-left">The first way I tried to store session data was with Flask-Session and the filesystem. This was the simplest way to store session data and it worked fine in test. The issues started when I deployed these changes to the dev site. It could create the session data just fine but everytime a new page loaded it would wipe all the existing data. The reason for this is pretty obvious in hindsight (or to anyone who took note of the warnings in the Flask Session docs). This site is deployed serverlessly on AWS Lambda which means that everytime a new page loads, it is actually a new server being spun up to serve that page. If we store session data on the server's filesystem, everytime a new page loads, we get a new filesystem and the data is apparently gone. So we need a method that doesn't rely on persisting information on the server.</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold my-4">Second Try: Flask-Session with Memcache (AWS ElastiCache)</h3>

    <p class="text-lg text-left">The second and most expensive way I tried to store session data was with Flask-Session and Memcache. This was a bit more complicated than the filesystem method because it required a new piece of infrastructure. I set up an AWS ElastiCache instance and configured Flask-Session to use it. There were two problems I came upon here. The first was the networking of my AWS resources. ElastiCache is designed to be internal to AWS, meaning it is mostly meant to be accessed by AWS resources. We are trying to access it from a Lambda function, so in luck there, but this meant that we had to modify our deployment to be within the same Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) as the ElastiCache deployment. On top of this, a Network Address Translation (NAT) Gateway was also needed to make this site still be accessible from outside the VPC. And it turns out that both of these new components (ElastiCache database and NAT Gateway) are expensive. They're not outrageous if you already have monthly tech infrastructure costs, but if you're trying to keep your personal site mostly in free tier, they're insane. So I abandoned this plan too and was about ready to give up on the Spotify stats app.</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold my-4">Third Try: Flask's Built-In <i>session</i> Object</h3>

    <p class="text-lg text-left">Then I realized I had made a signinificant oversight in my initial overview of the options available to me. Flask (without Flask Session) has a built in session object. And that session stores data locally to the user's computer. I tried this way out and it worked immediately. Even better, it incurs no added cost and doesn't add any dependencies to the site (keeping bundle size down). So this is what I went with. And it still gives the ability to have a page where you (the user) can <a href="{{ url_for('session_info') }}" target="_blank" class="font-medium text-blue-600 underline dark:text-blue-500 hover:no-underline">view and delete session data</a> from this site.</p><br />

    <p class="text-lg text-left">This was my first foray into using session data on a website. If you have experience with it and want to provide feedback/critique or if you have none and want to know more about my setup, please send me an email. :)</p>
