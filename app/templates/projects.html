The Spotify Web API requires an access token which is retrieved with a combination of the app's API key and the user's login information. The access token then has to be stored somehow so that the user doesn't have to login again everytime the app makes a request. In the case of a web app, it is stored as session data. And as it happens, there are a lot of ways to store session data for a website.") }}

The first is the no-cloning theorem which simply states that it is impossible to create an identical copy of a particle. The second is that measurement of a quantum particle is basis dependent and measuring in one basis can distort or destroy the information held in another. Taken together, these principles allow for two parties to exchange a secret key over a public network without any third party being able to reliably figure out the key. Many protocols exist for distributing such 'quantum
    keys', the first of which was created in 1984.") }}

I built a CI/CD pipeline for this website using GitHub Actions as the workflow framework and a number of tools along the way for testing, deploying, and securing automatically. At the highest level, on each code commit it will run tests and checks on the code base, create a deployment package and deploy it to a dev site, run tests and security checks on the dev site, and then deploy to production once the code is merged to the main branch.") }}

In the paper I introduce the reservoir computing framework, necessary grounding in ML, the characteristics of good physical reservoirs, and a few case studies: mechanical, electronic, and quantum. While this is still a relatively new field, the potential for chaotic systems prediction, smart mechanical sensors and more is potentially revolutionary across a wide range of sciences and industries. I also gave a talk that mimics the structure of the paper.") }}
