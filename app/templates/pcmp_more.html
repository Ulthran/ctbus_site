The software needs of these labs range from high (a core of PhD bioinformatians who need performant and reliable big data pipelines as well as the flexibility to perform fine grained statistical analyses) to medium (mostly wet lab experiments that need follow up analysis with user-friendly and reproducible pipelines) to low (mostly wet lab and clinical work, lab members who like to live in spreadsheet land but might want a few tasks automated). It's my job as the developer for the PCMP (I'm the first and so far only pure developer for the program) to create, enhance, and maintain software for the labs in the program. If you have any unanswered questions about my work with the PCMP please reach out, I love talking about this stuff.") %}{% endcall %}
