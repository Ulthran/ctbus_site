The summer after my Junior year in college I interned with a team under the GreenLake umbrella that was in charge of a large scale data migration project, the gist of which was taking data from HPE servers and devices all over the world and funneling into centralized sources. The pipeline for doing this was enourmously complex, needing to handle the scale and also be dynamic enough to work with all the different types of incoming data and be manipulable as it works. I spent most of my time working as a member of a particular scrum team on this project. At one point I helped to implement an AST for parsing the pipeline DSL into a database agnostic form. At another I struggled to keep up with K, the resident pipeline expert, on a deep dive into category theory to build out some of the core flexibility of the transfer layer.") }}

I interned with them the summer after my Freshman year of college to create a unit testing framework for their codebase. I wasn't at all familiar with embedded code or test frameworks at the time so most of my time was spent in learning but I did end up with a test suite using GTest and comprising a few tests for circular image handling code (testing was later expanded by people who knew the codebase better than me). The next winter I contracted briefly with them again, this time creating a couple internal utility websites for inventory management tasks.") }}

I interned with them as a Junior and Senior in high school, working with the CEO to create a reliable and user friendly inventory management system using MS Access. I migrated the data from spreadsheets they were using and then created forms and macros for common tasks, including compiling saftey data sheets for any kit, which had previously been an annoying manual task.") }}
