    <p class="text-lg text-left">Deploying a zappa site takes time. Not that much, a couple minutes, but it means that it's a pain to do regularly which means that I didn't do it regularly. Instead I developed and tested with a local version and then would push straight to production once that was where I wanted it. And that approach worked, but it had some downsides, such as having to manually deploy changes (even just once in a while) and not catching deployment issues early (like installing huge dependencies and having lambda reject the package for being too big). These are the kind of issues that scale with complexity so I figured I'd get a jumpstart and automate as much as I could now, get the infrastructure in place to go above and beyond the project's CI/CD needs. The end goal is a pipeline like this: version control -> tests/static analysis -> build & push artifact -> dev deployment -> test dev deployment -> prod deployment (on PR merge)</p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold my-4">Starting with Simple CI</h3>

    <p class="text-lg text-left">As a starting point, I need to implement some basic CI workflows, which I'm already familiar with from developing scientific software packages. I use GitHub Actions (GHA) for everything cause that's what I'm used to. Adding a unit testing workflow with PyTest is relatively straightforward:</p>

    <div class="text-left p-1 my-4">
        <code>
.github/workflows/tests.yml
        </code>
        <pre class="bg-gray-800 text-white rounded-lg shadow-lg px-4 py-1 overflow-auto max-h-96">
            <code class="language-yaml">
name: Tests

on:
pull_request:
    branches: [main, master]

    branches: [main, master]

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - name: Checkout Code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

    - name: Install Dependencies
        run: |
        python -m pip install --upgrade pip
        pip install -r requirements.txt
        pip install -r dev-requirements.txt
    
    - name: Run Tests
        run: |
        pytest tests/
            </code>
        </pre>
    </div>

    <p class="text-lg text-left">With that in place, it's time to develop some unit tests for the site. And lucky for us there's very little to actually unit test. At this point there's really just the main app file, which contains routes and not much more, and a <code>data_utils.py</code> that has one function for retrieving Chess.com stats. Even though it integrates with a 3rd party and so shouldn't technically be included in unit testing, we're gonna call it a unit test anyways.</p>

    <div class="text-left p-1 my-4">
        <code>
tests/unit/test_data_utils.py
        </code>
        <pre class="bg-gray-800 text-white rounded-lg shadow-lg px-4 py-1 overflow-auto max-h-96">
            <code class="language-python">
from app.data_utils import get_chess_stats


def test_get_chess_stats():
    # Chess.com's "unofficial" API, meaning they recognize people use it as is
    # but don't provide guarantees that it will stay the same.
    assert not any([v == "ERR" for k, v in get_chess_stats().items()])
            </code>
        </pre>
    </div>
    
    <p class="text-lg text-left">Upon commiting these two files, the tests workflow runs and succeeds! Now I can develop with the confidence that my makeshift Chess.com API won't break (either with my changes or theirs, again, not really a proper unit test). I also want a linting workflow to enforce formatting for my codebase. I'm going to use Super Linter cause it's a super easy way to manage linting many different languages through GitHub Actions.</p>

            </code>
        </pre>
    </div>

    <p class="text-lg text-left">With that commited as well, I can now develop with confidence that my changes won't introduce poorly formatted code or break existing functionality! But there's one more thing I want to add before moving on and that's static analysis. Especially since I have started using AI dev tools like GitHub Copilot and ChatGPT for code generation, it's important to have constant static analysis checks to catch dangerous patterns I don't catch. Codacy links directly with GitHub to do its work without any configuration files necessary (see <a href="https://docs.codacy.com/v3.4/getting-started/getting-started-with-codacy/" target="_blank">Codacy Docs</a>).</p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold my-4">Turning Focus to CD</h3>

    <p class="text-lg text-left">In the interim between the last step and now, I took <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/learning-login/share?forceAccount=false&redirect=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.linkedin.com%2Flearning%2Fdevops-foundations-continuous-delivery-continuous-integration-14449917%3Ftrk%3Dshare_ent_url%26shareId%3DnCbUEnMCR9CpkPo%252Buw6xlw%253D%253D" target="_blank">DevOps Foundations</a> on LinkedIn Learning, leading me to think I should expand my CI to include CD. This presents a few challenges I've never faced before: 1) interacting with GitHub's artifact repository, 2) authorizing a GitHub Action to deploy changes to AWS, and 3) performing tests and security audits on the deployed site. Turns out the first one, interacting with artifacts, is super easy! They already have prebuilt actions for doing everything you need to do (push and pull) and zappa has utilities for building and deploying zips (instead of doing it all in one command).</p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold my-4">AWS and GitHub Actions</h3>

    <p class="text-lg text-left">Authorizing a GHA runner to interact with AWS was not quite as straightforward, despite being relatively well documented. As with most things involving AWS IAM, there are a lot of options that introduce a lot of complexity. Most of the work on GitHub's side is covered by the <a href="https://github.com/aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials" target="_blank">Configure AWS Credentials</a> action. My first thought was that I'd be able to just plop credentials for an AWS profile in as GHA environment variables but the recommendation is not to do that, instead preferring OpenID Connect. Through this method, an Idendity Provider (IdP) is setup in AWS IAM and then a Role is created that trusts the IdP. That Role can then be used with GHA. Setting up the IdP in AWS IAM and connecting the Role are covered in <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/deployment/security-hardening-your-deployments/configuring-openid-connect-in-amazon-web-services#adding-the-identity-provider-to-aws" target="_blank">Configuring OpenID Connect in Amazon Web Services</a>. The only setup left to do in AWS then is to create a Policy for the Role that will give zappa the necessary permissions to do its work. I couldn't find any examples of such a Policy so I've included the one I pieced together here.</p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold my-4">Testing an Active Website</h3>

    <p class="text-lg text-left">This is a part I have no prior experience with. I need tools which I can run in GHAs that will perform a healthy subset of the possible classes of tests for web apps. This article on <a href="https://www.browserstack.com/guide/how-to-perform-website-qa-testing">How to Perform Website QA Testing</a> is pretty helpful in creating a mental framework for this, but probably goes more in depth than I need. My thinking is that the major ones to focus on will be functionality testing, cross-browser/cross-device testing, accessibility testing, and penetration testing.</p>

    <p class="text-lg text-left">The first two, functionality and cross-browser/cross-device testing, can both be handled by Selenium, which is nice enough to have a solid Python interface for us to use (as well as every other language you could want). The core idea of selenium is that you can set up a WebDriver object that mimics the behavior of whichever browser you want and then use that object to perform actions on the website as the user would and check that the results are as expected. This allows you to abstract away problems with display, browser, os, etc. and just focus on testing critical user paths. So the first step is to setup a WebDriver in PyTest.</p>

    <p class="text-lg text-left">OK I went overboard and setup two WebDrivers: one for testing Chrome and one for testing Chrome on a mobile device. I also created this weird <code>arg</code> function so that I can use PyTest fixture parameterization to run the same tests on each of my WebDriver fixtures.</p>

    <p class="text-lg text-left">Obviously this test is little more than a PoC for running tests on multiple web drivers though. In order to actually start testing useful features, I read the Selenium docs and learned about their PageObject testing structure. Under this paradigm, each page of the site is abstracted to a PageObject that models objects on the page within the test code. These PageObjects can then be used to perform higher-level feature testing without worrying about implementation changes in the actual page. Here's an example of that with a button for hiding graphs (not the most critical, but nice to know it will work).</p>
