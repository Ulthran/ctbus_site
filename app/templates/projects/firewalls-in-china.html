    <p class="text-lg text-left">In the fall of 2019, I spent four months studying Mandarin in Harbin, China with <a href="https://cetacademicprograms.com/college-study-abroad/programs/china/harbin-chinese-language/" target="_blank" class="font-medium text-blue-600 underline dark:text-blue-500 hover:no-underline">CET</a> and the <a href="http://en.hit.edu.cn/" target="_blank" class="font-medium text-blue-600 underline dark:text-blue-500 hover:no-underline">Harbin Institute of Technology</a> (HIT). As part of the program, I was able to design a 1-on-1 class with a HIT professor and chose to do it on computer networks and their security (particularly relevant in China, where there is a nationwide firewall preventing access to certain parts of the internet). The end result was a three page paper summarizing the course's content and a number of shorter intermediate papers going into detail on each week's subject.</p>

    <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold my-4">Why'd You Do This</h3>

    <p class="text-lg text-left">I had taken Latin for five years previously (7th - 11th grades) but didn't have room for it in my schedule senior year of high school so figured it was time for a change of pace when I got to college. I started taking Chinese and ended up taking a Chinese class for eight of my twelve terms at Carleton (we did trimesters). This includes the fall of Junior year (about half a year before Covid came to the United States) when I did a semester abroad in Harbin, China, which is the northernmost city with a population over five million in China. The program involved developing an independent study type of class, in addition to three other classes, all taught in Chinese and we were only allowed to speak Chinese unless calling our families. </p>
