    <p class="text-md italic">NOTE: As of writing, this is still very much a work in progress. Don't go to these links expecting polished results (or even a living webpage sometimes).</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold my-4">Inspiration</h3>

    <p class="text-lg text-left">I've seen Moneyball (one of the few Michael Lewis books I actually haven't read though). I know the power of data to uncover non-obvious and non-trivial truths about sports. And with frisbee still being a relatively niche and low budget sport, I think there is a big opportunity to translate existing tools from more established field sports and apply them to frisbee. And I wanted more practice with developing a fullstack web/mobile app so this seemed like the perfect project to undertake.</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold my-4">Initial Work and Challenges</h3>

    <p class="text-lg text-left">I started this project by deciding on a split web/mobile architecture where the web side of things would do most of the heavy lifting, handling the pre- and post-game management, and the app would be purely dedicated to real time simplified team management and data input.</p>

    <p class="text-lg text-left">The website I built with Flask and deployed serverlessly with Zappa because I had experience with that from this site (and others). The tricky part from here, was to integrate with the Cognito authentication that comes automatically with the Amplify app. There is already a library for managing users on a Flask site via a Cognito User Pool which wasn't too difficult to get in place (a few extra things needed setup on the backend for it to work properly). However, this doesn't solve the problem of getting user-level access to other Amplify resources, such as the GraphQL API. For this, I needed to make modifications to the flask-cognito-lib plugin that would work with the Cognito ID token (not to be confused with the Cognito access token). With this token (and more backend finagling in the Identity Pool) the site was able to authenticate users and then access relevant backend resources accordingly.</p>

    <p class="text-lg text-left">The app I built with React Native in AWS Amplify because it was one of the few options that enabled me to have a web-based interface for the app component as well. And as much as I'd like the adhere to the modern idea of separating app and mobile codebases, I think there will be opportunity in this case for reasonably useful and low risk overlap in usage. </p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold my-4">Current Work</h3>

    <p class="text-lg text-left">My focus now is to provide a POC for the back end of the pipeline, essentially the data analytics portion. This means expanding the data model to accomodate the current MVP I have in mind as well as thinking about as many possible future features as I can and trying to make sure the model is extensible to these. I also have some kinks to work out with the dev site deployments and with the authentication mechanisms. Once that's in place, I'd like to use it (just the back third) for a bit and build up a bit of a personal database of game info on which to continue refining the data analysis portion.</p>

    <p class="text-lg text-left">Somewhere between finishing the above MVP and acquiring all the data in the world, I'll need to get back to focusing on the front two thirds again, first expanding the data model to accomodate the types of game and tournament planning I want to enable for teams and then actually building out to provide the critical part of the UX. Certainly a long way to go but I'll keep chipping away at it and hopefully piece by piece build something people (including myself) will want to use.</p>

    <h3 class="text-xl font-bold my-4">Crazy Aspirations</h3>

    <p class="text-lg text-left">One of my pipe dreams when starting this project was to create a platform where a user could speak directly at their phone/tablet over the course of a game and it would parse out relevant "game events" from the dialogue and timestamp them. This comes from the number one issue I've heard from users of existing apps for this type of thing: "it's happening too fast and I don't want to look at my phone that much." If instead they could just be narrating the game, that could make it dramatically easier to follow and record the action in a structured format. If any video of the game is also timestamped, it will enable me to sync up any kind of video/analysis pairing features.</p>

    <p class="text-lg text-left">Linking with other services, like Ultiworld for film and relevant articles, USAU for rosters and tournament info, etc. It would take a significant user base and a lot of talking but I am building this with the mindset that it could (keyword, could) be a one stop shop for all things ultimate. I feel like, along with being ambitious, this makes sure that as many doors as possible are open for development down the line.</p>
