<p class="text-lg text-left">WORK IN PROGRESS. My goal was originally to create a real-time stat tracking app so that coaches could easily and actively track touches, turnovers, scores, play time, etc during a game and receive suggestions on how to stick to whatever plan they create for player management. That still sounds cool but my attention has drifted towards the data processing and analytics end of the process. Focus is lacking but dreams are big.</p>
