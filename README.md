## About

This is a personal website for Charlie Bushman.

## Deployment

It is deployed as a static site on AWS S3. All the materials are hosted in a bucket and served as is. 

## Contributing

If you have thoughts on how I could improve the site, I'd love to hear them. It is, for now and the foreseeable future, pretty simplistic in design, but I will also be using it as a testing ground for anything in the web app arena I want to learn more about.
